<h1 style="color: white;text-align:center;"><b>Our Sassy CASI</b></h1>

<h2 style="color: silver; font-size:150%">Project goals</h2>

<p style="color: white; font-size: 140%">First of all, welcome to our site with our classy yet sassy A.I. Casi. CASI was developed to gauge and give the appearance of an A.I. that simulates emotions due to outside effects, whether others bias and environment related scenarios. CASI which stands for:  </p>


<ul style="color: white; font-size:120%">
	<li>COMPUTER</li>
	<li>AUTOMATED</li>
	<li>SENTIMENT</li>
	<li>INTELLIGENCE</li>
</ul>

<h3 style="color: silver; font-size:150%">Why CASI?</h3>
<ul style="color: white; font-size: 140%">
	<li>Psychological Analysis </li>	
	<li>Social experiment </li>	
</ul>

<h4 style="color: silver; font-size: 170%"><i><b>Psychological Analysis</b></i></h4>

<p style="color: white; font-size: 150%"> </p>

<p style="color: white; font-size: 120%">Psychology finds the mere exposure effect as a predetermined deposition on the human mind only due to our past interactions. It is similar to how we become so tolerant to the temperature. We in our minds set this as our sole basis for "normal" and we assume the accepted tolerance and the environment in which it was produced in. A better example of this phenomonom is the repeated song tendencies for radio stations; and marketing analyist have realized that the more played a song is,whether good or bad to our bias taste, we shall remember it and most likely will associate thoughts in which are positive and pleasant</p>

<p style="color: white; font-size: 120%"> As we further dive in this train of thought, our experiment comes down to  whether or not we can succeed in creating a similar " set of opinions" in our A.I. The question only becomes a matter answered through observation and how it will effect our understanding of the subject. Once exmained and studied in detail, not only on yourself but on the A.I. we can only guess and try to adjust to the situations in which CASI operates</p> 

<h5 style="color: silver;font-size: 170%"><i><b>Social Experiment</b></i></h5>

<p style="color: white;font-size: 140%"> Experiments always gives us a greater leap towards a deeper meaning. Look at this from two perspectives</p>

<ul style="color: white; font-size: 130%">
	<li> Experimental Circumstance</li>
	<li>Deeper Meaning Analyzed</li>
</ul>

<h6 style="font-size: 150%; color: white"><i>Experimental Circumstance</i></h6>

<p style="color: white; font-size: 130%">We can only gain values by subjecting our A.I. to the the opinions in which the program can then only decide. As it frequents "its based opinion to our viewers" at a random interval, we can see what it truly wants from the design. </p> 

<h7 style="font-size: 150%; color: white"><i>Deeper Meaning Analyzed</i></h7>

<p style="color: white; font-size: 130%"> Our program has now been exposed to other sources and we can see if the range and amount of time exposed plays a great role on the varying design of the A.I. One could continue to run test on this discovering observations about self and their programming entities </p>

<h8 style="font-size: 150%; color: white"><i>Fun project to build on</i></h8> 

<p style="color: white; font-size: 130% "> Fun projects always drive imagination with productivity and in our case a sense of wonder that can better our understanding of ourselves and human interactions. While we tend to live in the world of sciences and physics, we still tend to attempt to always bring a psychological empathy into these fields. Only now we are going to direct these observances in our program which makes it easy to access CASI</p>

<h9 style="font-size: 140%; color: white"><b>How did we make it through this project</b></h9>

<ul style="color: white; font-size: 140%">
	<li>All work No play</li>	
	<li>Friendly Support</li>
	<li>Emotional Support</li>	
</ul>

<h10 style="color: white; font-size: 140%">All Work No play</h10>

<p style="color: white; font-size: 130%">Our team had a great deal of fun creating this project and being out this weekend to meet such great sponsors, people to mingle with, and enjoy opportunites in which you can not experience elsewhere. My team and I would agree that this has been a test of our limits as we have barely slept a wink throughout this weekend. WIth our project taking most of our time and hitting all the points in which we could we will never regret this.</p>

 <h11 style="color: white; font-size: 140%">Friendly Support</h11>

 <p style="color: white; font-size: 130%">We could not have made it this far without support of our friends, some of which we just met. As well as the sponsors and mentors here to help along the way. MLH has also played a great role with the software and learning sections on their website to which help further our development of CASI. </p>

<p style="color: white; font-size: 140%"><h12> Emotional Support</h12></p>

<p style="color: white; font-size: 130%">Remember at all times, there will be instances where you need to lean on someone or in which someone can give you a hand. However in our case, our mascot may give you a <i>Paw</i> instead. We leave you with this smile of encouragement and strength to <b><i>Charge On</i></b></p>
