<h2 style="color: silver">Project goals</h2>

<p style="color: white;">First of all, welcome to our site with our classy yet sassy A.I. Casi. CASI was developed to gauge and give the appearance of an A.I. that simulates emotions due to outside effects, whether others bias and environment related scenarios. CASI which stands for:  </p>


<ul style="color: white;">
	<li>COMPUTER</li>
	<li>AUTOMATED</li>
	<li>SENTIMENT</li>
	<li>INTELLIGENCE</li>
</ul>

<h3 style="color: silver;">Why CASI?</h3>
<ul style="color: white">
	<li>Psychological Analysis </li>	
	<li>Social experiment </li>
	<li>Fun project to build on </li>	
</ul>

<h4 style="color: gray; font-size: 130%><i><b>Psychological Analysis</b></i></h4>

<p style="color: white; font-size: 150%"> </p>

<p style="color: white;font-size: 150%"><i>CASI</i> our project that can interpret "opinion" which helps illustrate our AI's perception only through the <b>Mere Exposure Effect</b></i> as studied in psychology.</p>

<p style="color: white">Psychology finds the mere exposure effect as a predetermined deposition on the human mind only due to pur past interactions. It is similar to how we become so tolerant to the temperature. We in our minds set this as our sole basis for "normal" and we assume the accepted tolerance and the environment in which it was produced in. A better example of this phenomonom is the repeated song tendencies for radio stations and marketing analysist realize that the more played a song is,whether good or bad to our bias taste, we shall remember it and most likely will associate thoughts with it as pleasant and quaint</p>

<p style="color: white"> As we further dive in this train of thought, our experiment comes down to  whether or not we can succeed in creating a similar "opinions" in our A.I. The question only becomes a matter answered through observation and how it will effect our understanding of the subject. Once exmained and studied in detail, not only on yourself but on the A.I. we can only guess and try to adjust to the situations in which CASI operates</p>

<h5 style="color: silver;font-size: 150%"><i><b>Social Experiment</b></i></h5>

<p style="color: white;font-size: 105%"> Experiments always gives us a greater leap towards a deeper meaning. Look at this from two perspectives</p>

<ul style="color: white">
	<li> Experimental Circumstance</li>
	<li> Deeper Meaning Analyzed </li>
</ul>

<h6 style="font-size: 120%; color: white"><i>Experimental Circumstance</i></h6>

<p style="color: white">We can only gain values by subjecting our A.I. to the the opinions in which the program can the only then decide. As it frequents "" at a random interval we can see what it truly wants from the design. </p> 

<h7 style="font-size: 120%; color: white"><i>Deeper Meaning Analyzed</i></h7>

<p style="color: white"> Our program has now been exposed to other sources and we can see if the range and amount of time exposed plays a greate role on the varying design of the A.I. ONe could continue to run tesat on this </p>
